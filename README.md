# 🚀 Asteroids Game (Python)

This repository contains the **Asteroids Game** project, developed as part of the [Boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python). This project recreates the classic arcade experience of navigating a spaceship, shooting asteroids, and avoiding collisions.

## 🌟 Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the spaceship with fluid movement mechanics.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Destroy asteroids with precise shooting.
- **Asteroid Dynamics**: Randomly generated and splitable asteroids for endless gameplay.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your progress with a live score counter.
- **Game Over**: Immersive game over screen with the final score and objects frozen in their last positions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pygame**: Library used for game development.
- **Random Module**: For asteroid generation and movement dynamics.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures reliability and correctness of gameplay mechanics.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **Game Development Fundamentals**: Built a structured game loop and managed game states.
- **Entity Interactions**: Implemented collision detection and event-based interactions.
- **Code Modularity**: Organized the code into reusable modules and utilities.
- **Testing Practices**: Wrote unit tests for game entities and mechanics.

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability of the following:

- **Player Mechanics**: Movement, shooting, and interactions.
- **Asteroid Behavior**: Random spawning, splitting, and collisions.
- **Game Logic**: Scoring updates and game over conditions.

To run tests, simply execute:

```bash
pytest
```
