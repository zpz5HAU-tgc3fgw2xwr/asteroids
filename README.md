# 🚀 Asteroids Game (Python)

This repository contains the **Asteroids Game** project, developed as part of the [Boot.dev course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python). This project focuses on creating a command-line game that simulates the classic arcade experience of navigating and shooting asteroids.

## 🌟 Features

- **Player Movement**: Navigate a spaceship across a 2D grid.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Destroy asteroids with precise shooting.
- **Random Asteroid Generation**: Infinite gameplay with dynamically generated obstacles.
- **Scoring System**: Track and display player performance.
- **Game Over Conditions**: Realistic collision handling and restart options.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Game Loops**: Implemented efficient and smooth gameplay loops.
- **Random Module**: Used for asteroid generation.
- **CLI Interactivity**: Intuitive command-line interface for gameplay.
- **Unit Testing**: Verifies game mechanics and logic.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Designing game loops and managing game states.
- Implementing collision detection for moving objects.
- Using Python’s random module for dynamic gameplay elements.
- Writing unit tests to validate game logic and mechanics.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests were written to ensure the reliability of:

- Player movement and boundary checks.
- Accurate collision detection with asteroids.
- Correct scoring updates.
- Asteroid generation and removal.

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest
```
